Many of us love it. Certainly, like with any large city, there are people who dislike it. Over the last few years, however, there have been a number of fake, misleading, and/or downright hateful things spread on Twitter about London. Is this just random nonsense on the internet, or is it part of some overall campaign to accomplish some nefarious objective?\\n\\nDisclaimers: This particular series of posts is limited to Twitter. With assistance, further posts can be extended to cover other social media platforms. Some of the examples cite here contain objectionable material. It is included for instructional purposes only.\\n\\nIdentifying 11 London Disinformation Themes\\n\\nIn any analytical effort, definitions are important. It is hard to go hunting for something or collect the necessary data if we do not properly identify what it is that we are looking for.\\n\\nI have looked at thousands of London misinformation and disinformation tweets, and they generally follow one theme, or else multiple themes. Some themes are quite broad, while others are narrow in scope. Some tweets may fall into multiple categories. For lack of better definitions (and I would be happy to eventually sharpen these definitions further), I have developed these 11 broad categories, each with one or more examples. There are more, but this analysis, for now, focus on these 11 categories.\\n\\n1. London No Go Zones\\n\\nThese tweets allege that London has \\u201cno go zones\\u201d as defined by Islam or ethnicity. Alternately, London is alleged to have areas where the police are not allowed to go because these areas are controlled by people of a specific ethnicity or members of a specific religion. Mostly, these tweets allege \\u201cIslamic No Go Zones,\\u201d although a few have alleged \\u201cno go zones where white people/Christians are not allowed.\\u201d A previous Bellingcat article from November 2018 addressed many of the commonly found \\u201cno go zone\\u201d memes.\\n\\nAGREE\\n\\nLONDON HAS NO GO ZONES\\n\\nMEANING NO WHITE PEOPLE TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY MUSLIMS\\n\\n68 SHARIA COURTS TO SELF GOVERN\\n\\nTHAT NOT ASSIMILATION https://t.co/uUxDWKFVeB \\u2014 bobby Fasano (@NeedyadocBobby) February 20, 2017\\n\\n2. London Sharia Law\\n\\nThese tweets allege that all or part of London is under \\u201cSharia law.\\u201d Alternately, they claim that London has Sharia courts/councils that overrule English law. Examples:\\n\\n#Londistan is real! The real London is long gone and taken over by Sharia Law. Stay out! https://t.co/3YYH8kMs4z \\u2014 Salty Florida (@Dolphinflats) June 18, 2019\\n\\n(Note that @Dolphinflats\\u2019 profile pic is a stock photo found on 679 other sites according to a TinEye image search.)\\n\\nBecause it seems Sharia Law (100 courts in London alone) has some how sneaked into the British way of life Because the police have to now thumb through two rule books to see if what someone is up to, is unlawful, these types of crimes go unpunished. Sharia supersedes our law ? https://t.co/6g7pq9awTG \\u2014 stevenflattery (@stevenflattery1) June 10, 2019\\n\\n3. London Sharia Patrols\\n\\nThese accounts allege that London actively has, in the present, \\u201csharia patrols\\u201d or \\u201cMuslim patrols.\\u201d\\n\\nIt is important to note that there were small, ad hoc attempts to do such \\u201cpatrols\\u201d some years ago but the participants were arrested and jailed. One example from 2013 is described here.\\n\\n\\\"Muslim patrols\\\" target drinkers and gays in London https://t.co/W828j1zYE1 via @Observers \\u2014 Yolimalintzin (@Yolimalintzin) June 13, 2019\\n\\n4. London Mosque Burning\\n\\nThese are accounts of a particular mosque being on fire. This is a fairly specific disinformation theme.\\n\\nOn September 26, 2015, the very large Baitul Futuh Mosque in Morden in South London suffered from a significant fire. The damage was repaired and the mosque reopened.\\n\\nHowever, at recurring intervals in following years, waves of tweets would claim that this was happening again, in real time.\\n\\nHere are some examples from 2017.\\n\\n5. London Murder Rate\\n\\nThese are claims that London\\u2019s murder rate is \\u201cskyrocketing\\u201d or else is \\u201chigher than New York\\u201d or is \\u201chighest ever.\\u201d\\n\\nThis particular theme exploits a small set of news articles from early 2018. I debunked these claims in an earlier Bellingcat article.\\n\\nThere was one month (Feb 2018) where New York City actually had noticeably fewer murders than greater London. In June 2019, there was a concentrated \\u201cfishwrapping\\u201d campaign to take one particular Reuters article and tweet it as if it were current news.\\n\\nLondon murder rate overtakes New York as knife crime rises https://t.co/4D6uQ1oEcB \\u2014 TK Burk (@tkburk_com) June 11, 2019\\n\\n6. London Knife Crime Misrepresentation\\n\\nThese are tweets exaggerating knife crime, such as conflating the number of reported \\u201cknife crimes\\u201d with \\u201cstabbings,\\u201d or reporting every stabbing as a \\u201cmurder.\\u201d\\n\\n7. UK Gun Control Laws \\u201cDisarming\\u201d London\\n\\nThis particular theme states or implies that gun laws have \\u201cdisarmed\\u201d the London population and have removed the ability of Londoners to defend themselves, as if Londoners were well-armed before the post-Dunblane firearms laws.\\n\\nThe Dunblane Massacre was a mass killing in Scotland in 1996, which resulted in a revision of firearms laws in the UK, banning private ownership of handguns.\\n\\nDid you know that London is disarmed? Not unarmed, disarmed. https://t.co/sJGMm7U0TI \\u2014 Chuck Woolery (@chuckwoolery) June 13, 2017\\n\\n8. London Is \\u201cBad\\u201d Because It Is \\u201cMulticultural\\u201d\\n\\nThese are tweets that imply that the diversity of London is a bad thing. This is a theme that can be hard to define, but it generally ties the city\\u2019s problems to one particular element \\u2014 a diverse population.\\n\\n5 killing in as many days in London. What a multicultural paradise. \\u2014 Alfred the Great (@GreaterBritain) June 19, 2019\\n\\n9. General Angst About London\\u2019s Muslim Mayor\\n\\nThese are tweets that are disparaging of Sadiq Khan based on his ethnicity or his Muslim religion. They often accuse Khan of being an immigrant (he is not, in fact, an immigrant) or use the racist epithet \\u201cPaki.\\u201d\\n\\nLondonistan\\u2019s muzzie mayor, sadiq khan, wears size 5 loafers and cannot refill his Midol thru their Socialized Medicine. Man Envy is an excruciating spectator sport. \\u2014 Stage Is Set 5:5 #TheyCannotStopWhatsComing (@IKeepStandingUp) May 17, 2019\\n\\nLondon mayor and paki Sadiq Khan is also plotting against India in today\\u2019s match! Time to sock it into him too! https://t.co/PgxXNBY4GP \\u2014 Chirantan (@DiaQueri) June 16, 2019\\n\\n10. Generic London \\u201cShithole\\u201d\\n\\nThis category is broadly defined as a tweets that use the epithet \\u201cShithole\\u201d or phrase \\u201cThird World Shithole\\u201d to denigrate London in general terms.\\n\\nSome of this rhetoric may be inspired by U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s famous use of \\u201cshithole\\u201d when describing various countries whose citizens seek to visit the U.S./immigrate to the U.S.\\n\\nIf you want more evidence of what @SadiqKhan has reduced London to then follow this account. It's now a third world shithole ruled by violence and intimidation. https://t.co/HNn6bl8E64 \\u2014 Sheldon Weston (@SheldonW65) June 19, 2019\\n\\n11. \\u201cLondonistan\\u201d / The Idea That London Is Majority Muslim\\n\\nThese are tweets that imply London\\u2019s population is majority Muslim or else use the word \\u201cLondonistan\\u201d in a disparaging context.\\n\\nYeah good luck. London is majority Muslim now and they don\\u2019t like gay people. Why is everyone so shocked \\u2014 Two Towns Over (@TwoTownsOver78) June 8, 2019\\n\\nThere's an awful lot of muzzies in Londonistan and Corbyn ever the opportunist will stoop just as low as you want to get their vote.\\n\\nThing is living in Londonistan he thinks it represents the demographic of England stupid little Marxist creep! ? https://t.co/Z4HX88KobM \\u2014 Tom Gardiner (@TomGardiner7) May 23, 2019\\n\\nHaving identified these 11 themes, I plan on following this up with a deep dive into Theme 5, i.e. the \\u201cfishwrapping\\u201d campaign to push outdated articles on London\\u2019s murder rates.\\n\\nRequest to Bellingcat readers: Analysis like this cannot thrive without data.

This event started as the annual \\u201cLobby Day\\u201d rally for the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL) but has quickly gotten out of control.\\n\\nEarlier this week, the FBI arrested several members of Neo-Nazi organization \\u201cThe Base\\u201d who were planning to attend the march with an illegal automatic weapon and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. Governor Northam has declared a \\u201cState of Emergency\\u201d in the city and banned firearms from the Capitol grounds. He justified this by stating his fear that some protesters attending the event, \\u201chave as their purpose not peaceful assembly but violence, rioting, and insurrection.\\u201d\\n\\nEvidence supporting this fear can be found on 4chan\\u2019s far-right /pol board, where at least one Richmond police officer appears to be providing protesters with inside information.\\n\\nWhat /pol Wants From January 20\\n\\n4chan\\u2019s /pol board is one of the largest white nationalist gathering places on the Internet. In the lead up to this much-anticipated rally a series of threads titled \\u201c/vsg/\\u201d (Virginian Spring General) have cropped up to help coordinate anons interested in attending the event. The posts range from general information\\u2026\\n\\n\\u2026to outright calls for racial violence and the start to a \\u201cboogaloo\\u201d (far-right terminology for a new civil war. As in, \\u2018Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo\\u2019).\\n\\nMediaMatters previously reported on some of these threads and noted: \\u201c\\u2026users have explicitly organized among themselves for the January 20 rally and have asked about \\u201ca meeting spot for anons that are showing up.\\u201d In one thread, users discussed which users would be \\u201ccommand[ing]\\u201d a \\u201cstation\\u201d to \\u201cserve\\u201d at the rally and having an \\u201calert for weapons free,\\u201d a term meaning permission to shoot at non-friendly targets.\\u201d\\n\\nA Law Enforcement Officer Appears\\n\\nAn anti-fascist activist, \\u201cB\\u201d, reached out to Bellingcat with a link to this archived version of a now-removed /vsg/ thread. In it, an individual with the poster ID \\u201c6RuLcY2g\\u201d claims to be a Richmond cop working the event and announces that he will be \\u201ctaking questions\\u201d.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, he posts a picture of his badge next to a crude approximation of the 4chan logo.\\n\\nThis in and of itself is not hugely noteworthy. In other /vsg/ threads, users have posted pretending to be law enforcement officers. They have even posted pictures of badges, like this:\\n\\nThis \\u201cinvestigator\\u201d badge is quite easily debunked as a fake via Google Image Search. But this Richmond police officer badge does not show up on Yandex or Google reverse image searches. And based on this tweet from the Richmond police, the badge posted onto /pol does seem to match the badges issued by the Richmond Police Department.\\n\\nI thank this activist for finding the tweet.\\n\\nA Conversation With Officer Anon\\n\\nThe anons of /pol are often outright Nazi sympathizers, and there are repeated calls in the thread for people to join or support The Base. As you might expect, the kind of people who announce their support of a terrorist network targeted by the FBI are deeply concerned about federal infiltrators.\\n\\nWithin these circles, the term \\u201cglownigger\\u201d and variations of the word \\u201cglow\\u201d are used to refer to government operatives who post on boards like 4chan to try and entrap individuals. Quite a few anons express significant distrust of the poster claiming to be a Richmond police officer.\\n\\nBut poster 6RuLcY2g makes no obvious attempts to entrap or encourage felonious behavior. Instead, he answers questions and attempts to provide anons with actionable intelligence on police plans for January 20. He notes that there will be \\u201cprobably 600-700\\u201d officers in attendance, tells them to \\u201cexpect double barriers\\u201d around the event area, and even warns his fellow channers to \\u201cwatch out for glow in the darks.\\u201d\\n\\nThe purported officer\\u2019s posts show a familiarity with the lingo used on /pol, including its casual racism and homophobia. In another post he claims to have been a regular user of the site since 2009.\\n\\nAnons repeatedly ask him if he intends to \\u201cstand down\\u201d, and accuse him of having ties to the \\u201cMossad\\u201d and \\u201cADL\\u201d (essentially accusing him of working for the Jewish cabal they believe exists). Another user asks him detailed questions about how the police might respond to the crowd.\\n\\nHe answers all these questions with a fair amount of detail, noting that \\u201cMossad and ADL don\\u2019t like people like me\\u201d and admitting that there are not enough police to stop the crowd if it gets out of control.\\n\\nAt one point he is asked how he and his fellow officers will be outfitted; whether they\\u2019ll be in normal uniforms or wearing a full tactical get-up. Directly below his response, another anon posts a colorized photograph of a midnight swearing-in ceremony for the Nazi SS.\\n\\nThe officer in question \\u2014 if he is an officer \\u2014 is careful enough to not state his own beliefs directly. Nor does he advocate any illegal behavior. But he does provide potentially useful insight into how he believes Richmond PD will respond to the protests, and the limitations of his department\\u2019s capabilities.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s probably worth noting that, on this same board, other users proudly display swastikas while they share information on how to conduct insurgent campaigns.\\n\\nIf the poster in question is, in fact, a Richmond police officer, he is an officer who is profoundly comfortable with Nazi iconography and explicit talk of insurgent warfare against the U.S. government.\",\n          \"\\n\\nIn the year since the shooting down of Flight MH17 in Ukraine on July 17th 2014 there have been many different theories about who was responsible and the exact circumstances under which MH17 was shot down. For much of that time those theories have fallen into two broad categories, that either a separatists controlled Buk shot down MH17, or a Ukrainian military aircraft. Since the official criminal and Dutch Safety Board investigations have begun governments have generally avoided making any specific claims about who was responsible, but in the days after MH17 was shot down governments were making various claims. The US and Ukrainian governments both claimed a Buk missile was responsible, while on July 21st the Russian Ministry of Defence gave an hour long press conference where they presented their evidence of who could have been responsible for the attack.\\n\\nThe press conference covered four main claims:\\n\\nThat a video published by the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior showing a Buk in separatist controlled Luhansk was in fact filmed in government controlled territory in another town.\\n\\nMH17 significantly changed course just before being shot down.\\n\\nRadar imagery shows an aircraft close to MH17 shortly after it was shot down.\\n\\nSatellite imagery shows Ukrainian Buk missile launchers operating on July 17th.\\n\\nSince the July 21st press conference it has been possible to establish that all four claims were false, and in some cases involved the Russian Ministry of Defence producing faked evidence to support their claims.\\n\\nThe Luhansk Video\\n\\nFollowing the downing of Flight MH17 the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior published a video that was filmed in the separatist controlled city of Luhansk, close to the Russian border with Ukraine, which they claimed showed a Buk, carrying three missiles instead of the usual four, heading towards the Russian border on the morning of July 18th.\\n\\nIn the Russian Ministry of Defence\\u2019s July 21st press conference they claimed that the video had in fact been filmed in a government controlled area:\\n\\nFor example, media circulated a video supposedly showing a Buk system being moved from Ukraine to Russia. This is clearly a fabrication. This video was made in the town of Krasnoarmeisk, as evidenced by the billboard you see in the background, advertising a car dealership at 34 Dnepropetrovsk Street. Krasnoarmeysk has been controlled by the Ukrainian military since May 11\\n\\nTo support this claim they provided an image of the billboard visible in the video, along with what they claimed the line of text read.\\n\\nUnfortunately for the Russian Ministry of Defence it was possible to establish the true location the video was filmed using open source investigation techniques, which confirmed the exact location in separatist controlled Luhansk. This location was visited by a Luhansk local who took photographs of the area which both helped confirm the location, and what was written on the billboard.\\n\\nHere it can be clearly seen that the text on the billboard is completely different from what the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed. This location was confirmed as being correct by journalists who visited the same location, including 60 Minutes Australia and Correctiv, who photographed a very specific piece of vandalism on the billboard.\\n\\nMH17\\u2019s Significant Course Change\\n\\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence presented the following image during the press conference, claiming that Flight MH17 had been significantly diverted from its course:\\n\\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence stated that:\\n\\nOn the scheme you can see the international airway. The Boeing-777 was supposed to fly on this airway. Draw your attention to the fact that the aircraft followed inside the specified air-corridor to Donetsk, then it deviated from the route to north. Meanwhile the maximum distance from the left border of the air-corridor was 14 kilometers. Then we can see that the Boeing-777 turned back to the borders of the specified air-corridor. Nevertheless Malaysian aircrew didn\\u2019t succeed the maneuver. At 17.20 we entered the event of the aircraft rate reduction, at 17.23 the aircraft\\u2019s point blinked off on the radar. Why did the aircraft cross the border of the air-corridor? Was it the navigation mistake, or the aircrew followed the Dnepropetrovsk ground control orders? We will find the answers after \\u201cblack boxes\\u201d and communication decoding\\n\\nThe preliminary Dutch Safety Board report did in fact answer the questions the Russian Ministry of Defence asked \\u201cafter \\u201cblack boxes\\u201d and communication decoding\\u201d. The Dutch Safety Board preliminary report in fact showed that MH17 had been on an entirely different course than the Russian Ministry of Defence had claimed, and had not changed course in the way described in the Russian Ministry of Defence imagery. A comparison of the Dutch Safety Board\\u2019s flight path and the Russian Ministry of Defence flight path can be seen below.\\n\\nAgain, we can clearly see that the Russian Ministry of Defence is making a claim that is simply untrue, and this is provable using publically available information.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s Radar Data\\n\\nThe Russian Ministry of Defence also presented radar data that showing Flight MH17, claiming \\u201cRussian system of air control detected the Ukrainian Air Force aircraft, purposed Su-25, moving upwards toward to the Malaysian Boeing-777. The distance between aircrafts was 3-5 kilometers.\\u201d Chief of Staff of the Air Force Lieutenant-General Igor Makushev was then invited to comment on the radar data.\\n\\n\\u201cAt 17.20 P.M. at the distance of 51 kilometers from the Russian Federation state boundary and the azimuth of 300 degrees the aircraft started to lose its speed obstructively which is quite distinctively to be seen on the table of the aircraft characteristics. At 17.21 35 seconds P.M. with the aircraft speed of 200 km/h at the point of the Boeing crash there is a new mark of the aircraft to be seen. The aircraft was steadily monitored by radar stations of Ust-Donetsk and Butirinskoe during 4 minutes period. Air control officer having enquired the characteristics of newly appeared aircraft couldn\\u2019t possibly get them because it is in all likelihood that the aircraft had no secondary deduction system amounted on it, which is put typically for military aircraft. The early detection of this aircraft appeared to be quite impossible because the air situation control is usually performed by radars working in a standby mode which detection possibilities at the given distance are over 5000 m altitude.\\n\\nThe detection of the aircraft turned out to be possible as the aircraft ascend it.\\u201d\\n\\nHowever, radar experts were interviewed by a number of news organisations who gave a different opinion, with Dutch NOS news asking four experts to give their opinions. Comments included \\u201cit is really impossible for [it to be] a fighter\\u201d, \\u201cno aircraft was in the vicinity of flight MH17\\u201d, \\u201cit seems likely that the signals are the wreckage of MH17\\u201d, and \\u201cfalling debris are the most likely explanation\\u201d. Again, another Russian claim that doesn\\u2019t stand up.\\n\\nRussian Satellite Imagery\\n\\nRussia also presented sets of satellite imagery showing three different locations, including two military bases and a field outside the town of Zaroshchens\\u2019ke. At one military base, the 1428, it was claimed images from July 14th and July 17th showed that a Buk missile launcher had moved from the base on July 17th.\\n\\nHowever, it was possible for Bellingcat to purchase an image from the satellite company Digital Globe of the same location on July 17th, and compare that image to the images presented by the Russian Ministry of Defence. For example, large areas of vegetation visible in the July 14th Ministry of Defence images were absent from the July 17th Digital Globe image.\\n\\nIt was also possible to find historical satellite imagery of the same location from July 2nd and 21st of the same area on Google Earth, which confirms the vegetation had be cleared weeks before July 17th.\\n\\nPatches of worn away grass visible in the Russian Ministry of Defence imagery were also absent in the Digital Globe July 17th imagery.\\n\\nBut, as with other discrepancies between the images, the patches of missing grass were visible in earlier historical imagery on Google Earth, clearly showing the Russian Ministry of Defence images were from weeks before MH17 was shot down.\\n\\nMore differences are detailed here, and images of the other areas also showed the dates provided by the Russian Ministry of Defence just didn\\u2019t match with publically available satellite imagery of the same areas around the same dates. In addition to that, the Zaroshchens\\u2019ke site, where the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed they detected two Ukrainian Buks, was under separatists control on July 17th and locals interviewed by Russian media stated no Buk missile launchers were in the area on that date, and no missiles were launched from the area.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that not only did the Russian Ministry of Defence lie about evidence it presented on July 21st, but also presented fake evidence in attempt to place blame on Ukraine for the shooting down of Flight MH17. The July 21st press conference represents nearly all the information the Russian government has presented on MH17 to the public, and it\\u2019s clear that the Russian governments reaction to the murder of 298 people was to lie, produced fake evidence, and attempt to deceive the public, the global community, and the families of the 298 people murdered on July 17th 2014. The one big question that remains is whether the Russian government presented this information to the criminal investigation into the downing of Flight MH17.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 585,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 170,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 590,\n        \"samples\": [\n          505,\n          586,\n          195\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 591,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

He was sentenced to four years in prison before his conviction was quashed – after he’d already served his time.\\n\\nIn a case which has hardly received any publicity, according to high court documents, Albanian Besnik Qema was asked to supply News of the World cocaine and a passport on a promise of job as security for a wealthy Arab family.\\n\\nThe High Court documents detail how in January 2005, Mazher Mahmood had asked Florim Gashi, a contact of his who he had used in previous “set-up” stings to find someone who could be implicated in a story he or the News of the World wanted to run about false passports, drugs and guns. Gashi then adopted the identity of a female called Aurora and through an internet chat room used by expatriate Albanians established contact with Qema.\\n\\nOver the course of lengthy 4 or 5 telephone calls, Gashi then “honey trapped” him. Using his false female identity, he held out the prospect of romance/sex between them and also the prospect Qema might be able to get employment as a security guard with a rich Arab family at the rate of £8,000 a month.\\n\\nGashi told Qema ‘she’ had facilitated a meeting between him and a member of this family called Mohammed, and Qema’s chances of employment chances of employment would be enhanced if he could supply the family with cocaine. And a false British passport. Mohammed was in fact Mazher Mahmood.\\n\\nQema obtained 3 grams of cocaine from a man called Mehmet who was an associate of his. On February 4th, at a pre-arranged meeting meeting at a McDonalds in Liverpool Street supplied the three individual wraps to Mohammed (Mahmood) in return for £210 and a further supply was discussed. Mahmood was accompanied by Kishan Athulathmudali, an employee of News of the World who was posing as a member of Mohammed’s family.\\n\\nGashi, again under the guise of Aurora, then asked Qema to obtain a false British passport for Mohammed, so it was said, Mohammed wanted one for his cousin who was in the country illegally. At a further meeting with Kishan, Qema was given a passport photograph to use for the fake passport and £200 deposit for it which he then handed to Mehmet.\\n\\nOn 11th February, arrangements are made between Qema and Aurora for more cocaine and the passport to be handed over to Mahmood the next day at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, London.\\n\\nMahmood then tipped off the police that an undercover operation had led the newspaper to discover via a confidential source [Gashi] that Qema was actively involved in crime and dealing with drugs and false passports and he had access to firearms. Mahmood did not tell the police the source was Gashi. The reason for this is because a case involving Gashi had already collapsed 18 months earlier when the Crown Prosecution Service had found Mahmood had paid Gashi £10,000 who then become main prosecution witness. It’s clear from then on, Mahmood had to hide Gashi from prosecutors.\\n\\nMahmood supplied the police with with a photograph of Qema and told them analysis had showed the powder already supplied by Qema on 4th February was cocaine. He also told them Qema would be in possession of more cocaine and a passport at a meeting arranged at the Hilton Hotel on 12th February.\\n\\nMahmood didn’t tell police of the circumstances in which Qema came to be in possession of cocaine and a fake passport, in particular, the inducement offered of a job as a security guard or that the drugs had been a suggested sweetener to enhance Qema’s chances of getting the job.\\n\\nOn 12th February, Qema met Mahmood as agreed at the Hilton Hotel. He was so terrified of carrying the drugs in his pockets, Mehmet delivered it to the hotel and gave it to Qema outside the hotel. Qema went back into the Hikton and was arrested by police in the coffee shop minutes later, in possession of both the cocaine and false passport.\\n\\nThe next day on 13th February News of the World ran the story under a Mazher Mahood byline story;\\n\\n‘Cops swoop after we expose a scandal; he [Qema] met us in McDonald’s at London’s Liverpool Street Station. After claiming he supplied drugs to celebs, Qema gave us three wraps of cocaine “it’s good stuff, around £70 a gram.”‘\\n\\n‘In another meeting, Qema turned into an immigrant smuggler. He said; “it’s £1,200 for a travel document and I can get you a passport for £1,700.”‘\\n\\n‘But evil Qema has another sideline. He told our reporter; “if you like, I can get you a gun. They start from £300″‘\\n\\nThere is also a quote given from ‘Aurora’ claiming Qema is a pimp.\\n\\nThe next day, Febuary the 14th Qema pleads guilty at Bow Street Magistrates Court to 3 charges: one supply of a class A drug (the 3 grams of cocaine supplied in McDonald’s), one of possession with intent to supply a class A drug, and one of possession of a false instrument (respectively the drugs and false French passport he had in his possession when arrested at the Hilton). He was remanded in custody and committed to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing.\\n\\nOn 14th March Qema appeared at the the Southwark Crown Court for sentence before HH Judge Dodgson. In his witness statement Mahmood did not reveal the name of Gashi, but said he was told of Qema activities by a confidential source and he exhibited one of the telephone calls between Qema and his confidential source [Gashi].\\n\\nDuring Qema’s plea in mitigation, an account was given to the Judge of his entrapment by Mahmood and his colleagues from the News of the World involving a female called Aurora. Counsel accepted on Qema’s behalf that; “It is one of those cases…where entrapment can be used as full mitigation, not a defence” and said “it is accepted that this defendant was a willing participant in the matter. It was also said Qema had been “momentarily blinded by an offer, as fake as it was, of a glamorous well paid job…”, that “he fully accepts by his plea of guilty that (the supply of drugs) was an entirely a stupid thing to do” and that entrapment “does not afford a full defence. He went in with his eyes open as it were.”\\n\\nThe Judge sentenced Qema to 4 ½ years imprisonment: 3 years for the supply of cocaine; 12 months concurrent for possession of cocaine with intent to supply and 18 months consecutive for possession of a false instrument.\\n\\nOn June 24 2005 Qema sentenced was reduced by 9 months on appeal.\\n\\nOn September 6th, three Scotland Yard detectives flew out to Dubrovnik, Croatia to interview Florim Gashi. Gashi claimed Mahmood had told him he needed a story about someone who could get a British passport, a gun and drugs, so Gashi had gone on the internet posing as a female under the name of Aurora and found Qema. He told police Qema was a nice man and that he had induced him to obtain drugs and a false passport. He said; “Qema said I can’t do this but for your sake I’ll do it but i won’t carry drugs in my pocket. I said please do it. Qema says he’ll ask his friend to bring the drugs up to the hotel.” Gashi tells detectives Mehmet brought the drugs to the meeting – not Qema.\\n\\nTwo more Scotland Yard detectives flew out to Vienna this time to Gashi again where he told the; “I feel particularly guilty about 2 cases. One has resulted in a totally innocent man being sentenced to 4 years [Qema]. Another is the girl whose child was taken into care.”\\n\\nThe very next month, in October, Guardian columnist Roy Greenslade revealed Scotland Yard were investigating Mazher Mahmood and News of the World – whilst collaborating at the same time – because of Gashi’s explosive new claims. However, Qema remains in prison.\\n\\nHe would remain there for almost another year.\\n\\nQema was released on license on 17th August 2006 but tagged, and made the subject of a curfew. The next day Qema sought leave to appeal against his conviction out of tint on the basis that material had come to light as a result of other trials which had taken place following “sting” operations by Mazher Mahmood and his associates, but the Court of Appeal declined jurisdiction: given his plea of guilty.\\n\\nThe previous month, Gashi told the jury at the red mercury trial he told that he set up the Victoria Beckham plot with Mahmood. He said; “Maz said I would get £10,000 and another £5,000 if they got prosecuted,” he added “I would get it if I could convince them to talk about the kidnap of Victoria Beckham and her children.” The case is thrown out – three men walk free.\\n\\nOn September 9th 2010 at Southwark Crown Court with the consent if the CPS, Qema was permitted to vacate his guilty plea. His conviction was the quashed.\\n\\nMr Bowen QC for Qema told the hearing Mr Mahmood knew there was little or no prospect Mr Qema being brough to or convicted after a “fair and impartial trial ” because he was aware that the crucial evidence on which the prosecution would be based, was that of Gashi, who’s evidence could not be relied on by the prosecution; and because he know Mr Qema had been entrapped and that if the circumstances of the entrapment had been known, it was unlikely that prosecution would be brought.\\n\\nThis case has never reported by the media – apart from Roy Greenslade four months later. New allegations of phone hacking is reported by New York Times the first week of September so that remains the agenda before it explodes in the Summer of 2011.\\n\\nRelated articles',\n",
